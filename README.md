# PandaPro
PandaPro is a fun, interactive app for kids that boosts creativity and learning through engaging animal-themed minigames.

## Context 📚
PandaPro was a school project developed from start to finish as part of Sheridan College's Interaction Design program. The goal was to learn and practice core web development skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while gaining hands-on experience with coding, design, and research. The project involved building a fully functional app, combining both creative and technical elements to deliver a complete solution.

## The Challenge 🧩
Address the gap in educational resources that entertain users and support learning.
Many educational apps fail to engage children, making learning uninteresting. Parents need resources that both entertain and support developmental skills, combining play with education in a fun, creative way.

## Features 📋
- Onboarding: Pick your minigame from a small selection of animal-themed, creative games!
- Listening Game: Unlock the power of play! Listen to animal sounds, guess the animal using voice input, and unlock surprises with every correct answer. A helpful hint system ensures learning and satisfaction.
- Sketchpad: You’ll receive a random animal prompt in this interactive painting game. Use the vibrant colour palette to bring your creation to life. When you’re done, save your masterpiece and keep the fun going with a new surprise every time!
